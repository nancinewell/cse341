Team 1 Project
We met on Wednesday and were able to distribute assignments after completing some further planning. Eric had to leave early, so we assigned him something we felt he could do based on where he is in the tutorials. Jake set up the github repo and base files for the project. Tyson was more heavily involved in the planning of the project. I have completed most of my assignments as far as I can before the others complete theirs. I’m awaiting the Edit Link to make sure my controller function works. I haven’t completed CSS as the others’ pages are not up yet. I feel that most of our team is working well together and working hard. Eric is very busy, and is behind in the class, so his contributions are a bit less than everyone else.
